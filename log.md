# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Working on the Tribute Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've committed to doing the 100 Days of Code Challenge. I want to learn some web technologies and refresh
my existing knowledge of others.

I'm refreshing my knowledge of Django by starting to rebuild my own [website](http://dave-ames.net) which has been
dormant for a while. My current plan is to use Django and Bootstrap for the site, and to host it on a Digital Ocean
Droplet. To do this however I need to refresh my knowledge of Django which I last did in anger about 8-9 years ago, I
also need to get up to speed with Bootstrap, which I've only fumbled my way through so far.

As a result I'm currently working through freeCodeCamp's tutorials and have reached the section which asks you to build
your own [Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) which I've started doing using the
CodePen site thing it asks you to use. Currently doing a Tribute Page to Freeborn John (John Lilburne) who was the
leader of the Levellers during the English Civil War. I'll finish that and try to finish the Django Tutorial today.

Tribute Page now completed. On to finish off the Django Tutorial.

### Day 2: February 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started work on Portfolio Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I haven't had anywhere near as much time to work on stuff today, but have started the Portfolio Page
Challenge from freeCodeCamp.

I've created the beginnings of the page and currently have a navBar and jumbotron set up. I've been using the W3Schools
Bootstrap4 Tutorial to help with the parts of Bootstrap I don't already know.

Didn't get much further with the Django Tutorial last night. Hopefully will get a chance to look at it tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed work on Portfolio Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Worked my way through the rest of the Portfolio Page. Added some Font Awesome Icons for the social media
  links, found a forked copy of the Github Repo with a Steemit one included, so cloned that and stored it locally, to
  access for the page, not sure how that will work on the CodePen version. Didn't have any time to look at the Django
  version of the tutorial today. [Github Repo](https://github.com/amos1969/portfolio)

### Day 4: February 20th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fairly minimal due to lots of other commitments

**Thoughts:** Ended up spending a few hours looking at reveal.js and playing with the code to get something I was happy
to use as a presentation. Sort of work but not.

### Day 5: February 21st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fairly minimal due to lots of other commitments, namely teaching 6 hours of OOP using Python

**Thoughts:** Ended up spending a few hours looking at some of the Javascript stuff related to Pandoc and reveal.js to
get an even snazzier presentation than yesterday's effort. I played with the code to get something I was even happier to
use as a presentation.

**Link to work:** Still a work in progress.
