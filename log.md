# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Working on the Tribute Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've committed to doing the 100 Days of Code Challenge. I want to learn some web technologies and refresh
my existing knowledge of others.

I'm refreshing my knowledge of Django by starting to rebuild my own [website](http://dave-ames.net) which has been
dormant for a while. My current plan is to use Django and Bootstrap for the site, and to host it on a Digital Ocean
Droplet. To do this however I need to refresh my knowledge of Django which I last did in anger about 8-9 years ago, I
also need to get up to speed with Bootstrap, which I've only fumbled my way through so far.

As a result I'm currently working through freeCodeCamp's tutorials and have reached the section which asks you to build
your own [Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) which I've started doing using the
CodePen site thing it asks you to use. Currently doing a Tribute Page to Freeborn John (John Lilburne) who was the
leader of the Levellers during the English Civil War. I'll finish that and try to finish the Django Tutorial today.

Tribute Page now completed. On to finish off the Django Tutorial.

### Day 2: February 18, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Started work on Portfolio Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** I haven't had anywhere near as much time to work on stuff today, but have started the Portfolio Page
Challenge from freeCodeCamp.

I've created the beginnings of the page and currently have a navBar and jumbotron set up. I've been using the W3Schools
Bootstrap4 Tutorial to help with the parts of Bootstrap I don't already know.

Didn't get much further with the Django Tutorial last night. Hopefully will get a chance to look at it tomorrow.

### Day 3: February 19, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Completed work on Portfolio Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts** Worked my way through the rest of the Portfolio Page. Added some Font Awesome Icons for the social media
  links, found a forked copy of the Github Repo with a Steemit one included, so cloned that and stored it locally, to
  access for the page, not sure how that will work on the CodePen version. Didn't have any time to look at the Django
  version of the tutorial today. [Github Repo](https://github.com/amos1969/portfolio)

### Day 4: February 20th, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fairly minimal due to lots of other commitments

**Thoughts:** Ended up spending a few hours looking at reveal.js and playing with the code to get something I was happy
to use as a presentation. Sort of work but not.

### Day 5: February 21st, 2018
**Today's Progress**: Fairly minimal due to lots of other commitments, namely teaching 6 hours of OOP using Python

**Thoughts:** Ended up spending a few hours looking at some of the Javascript stuff related to Pandoc and reveal.js to
get an even snazzier presentation than yesterday's effort. I played with the code to get something I was even happier to
use as a presentation.

**Link to work:** Still a work in progress.

### Day 6: February 22nd. 2018
**Today's Progress**: I spent the day preparing for an interview so didn't learn much that was new

**Thoughts:** I did however have to prepare a presentation for the interview on Friday. I wrote it using Markdown, then
used Pandoc to convert it to a Reveal.js presentation. Which I was then able to tinker with using javascript, html and
css wizardry to make it look a bit better. Still frustrating though as I wanted to do some coding but there wasn't time
to do it properly.
  

**Link to work:** Will commit it to github when I get a chance.

### Day 7: February 23nd. 2018
**Today's Progress**: I spent the day travelling too and from London for an interview

**Thoughts:** Today was a deadloss as I had no opportunity to do any coding and from leaving the house, travelling,
being interviewed and travelling back I spent 14 hours moving so didn't do any more when I got in.  

**Link to work:** N/A

### Day 8: Febrary 24th, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I managed to work through about 40 basic Jacascript challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I didn't realise that Javascript had both the mixed use of quote marks that Python has, and arrays that
aren't homogenous. Is it because the take var types which are treated as the same data types or is it much more like
duck typed Python?

### Day 9: February 25th, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I've completed 75 of the Javascript challenges on freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** Well, I've spent a couple more hours today going through the freeCodeCamp coding challenges. I managed 75
of the JavaScript ones, which isn't bad going. I've learnt about Javascript objects which was new and creating
Constructors in Javascript to create them (not sure if these are Javascript classes or if that is another part) they
also seem related to json which is a data format I've worked with in the past from Python. 

I've moved onto some more technical open-ended tasks, where the challenge is to get the automated tests to pass in
whatever way works. 

Today has been a lot less fraught than the last few in terms of time, so happier with my progress.

### Day 10: February 26th, 2018
**Today's Progress:** I completed another 6 of the tougher Javascript challenges in about an hour

**Thoughts:** I've moved on to the more open ended challenges, some of which have left me scratching my head. Often
I know an obvious way to solve them in a language like Python, but using Javascript is part of my raison-d'etre for the
whole escapade, and I'm quite enjoying the learning something new aspect of it all.

### Day 11: February 27th, 2018
**Today's Progress:** Finished off the Basic Algorithm Scripting Challenges

**Thoughts:** Some of the solutions were incredibly straightforward, some were slightly more problematical. Even then
I'm not always sure my solutions are efficient, when using Javascript. The final challenge involved writing a ROT13
function to do Caesar Ciphers with.
