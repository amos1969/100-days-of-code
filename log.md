# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 17, 2018 
**Today's Progress**: Working on the Tribute Page Challenge from freeCodeCamp

**Thoughts:** I've committed to doing the 100 Days of Code Challenge. I want to learn some web technologies and refresh
my existing knowledge of others.

I'm refreshing my knowledge of Django by starting to rebuild my own [website](http://dave-ames.net) which has been
dormant for a while. My current plan is to use Django and Bootstrap for the site, and to host it on a Digital Ocean
Droplet. To do this however I need to refresh my knowledge of Django which I last did in anger about 8-9 years ago, I
also need to get up to speed with Bootstrap, which I've only fumbled my way through so far.

As a result I'm currently working through freeCodeCamp's tutorials and have reached the section which asks you to build
your own [Tribute Page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tribute-page) which I've started doing using the
CodePen site thing it asks you to use. Currently doing a Tribute Page to Freeborn John (John Lilburne) who was the
leader of the Levellers during the English Civil War. I'll finish that and try to finish the Django Tutorial today.

Tribute Page now completed. On to finish off the Django Tutorial.
